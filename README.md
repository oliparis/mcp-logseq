## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Enable LogSeq API
1. **Settings** → **Features** → Check "Enable HTTP APIs server"
2. Click the **API button (🔌)** in LogSeq → **"Start server"**
3. **Generate API token**: API panel → "Authorization tokens" → Create new

### Step 2: Add to your MCP client (No Installation Required!)

#### Claude Code
```bash
claude mcp add mcp-logseq \
  --env LOGSEQ_API_TOKEN=your_token_here \
  --env LOGSEQ_API_URL=http://localhost:12315 \
  -- uv run --with mcp-logseq mcp-logseq
```

#### Claude Desktop
Add to your config file (`Settings → Developer → Edit Config`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-logseq": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--with", "mcp-logseq", "mcp-logseq"],
      "env": {
        "LOGSEQ_API_TOKEN": "your_token_here",
        "LOGSEQ_API_URL": "http://localhost:12315"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Codex CLI

With [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) installed and Logseq's HTTP API running (Step 1), add this to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[mcp_servers.logseq]
command = "uv"
args = ["run", "--with", "mcp-logseq", "mcp-logseq"]

[mcp_servers.logseq.env]
LOGSEQ_API_TOKEN = "YOUR_LOGSEQ_TOKEN"
LOGSEQ_API_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:12315"
```

Replace `YOUR_LOGSEQ_TOKEN` with your Logseq token. If Codex cannot find `uv`, run `which uv` in Terminal and use the full path for `command`. Keep your token private.

Use the API base address above, **without `/mcp`**. Codex runs this adapter through STDIO; the adapter connects to Logseq's regular HTTP API.

Restart Codex, open a new local task, and ask:

> Use Logseq to list my journal pages, then read today's journal. Do not change anything.

Keep Logseq and its API server running. Codex starts the adapter automatically—no tunnel or separate Terminal window is needed.

*Tested with a Logseq DB graph for page listing and journal retrieval. This setup is for local Codex tasks, not cloud-hosted ChatGPT Chat.*

#### OpenCode

Add to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "mcp-logseq": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["uv", "run", "--with", "mcp-logseq", "mcp-logseq"],
      "enabled": true,
      "environment": {
        "LOGSEQ_API_URL": "http://localhost:12315",
        "LOGSEQ_API_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Start Using!
```
"Please help me organize my LogSeq notes. Show me what pages I have."
```

## 🔬 Vector Search (Optional)

Semantic search over your Logseq graph using configurable embeddings — find notes by meaning, not just keywords. Searches across all your pages using vector similarity and full-text search combined, with cross-language support.

Use [Ollama](https://ollama.com) for fully local embeddings, OpenAI, or another OpenAI-compatible embeddings endpoint. [LanceDB](https://lancedb.com) remains local in every configuration. Hosted providers receive the note text being embedded.

### 🎨 Smart Markdown Parsing (v1.1.0+)

The `create_page` and `update_page` tools now automatically convert markdown into Logseq's native block structure:

**Markdown Input:**
````markdown
---
tags: [project, active]
priority: high
---

# Project Overview
Introduction paragraph here.

## Tasks
- Task 1
  - Subtask A
  - Subtask B
- Task 2

## Code Example
```python
def hello():
    print("Hello Logseq!")
```
````

**Result:** Creates properly nested blocks with:
- ✅ Page properties from YAML frontmatter (`tags`, `priority`)
- ✅ Hierarchical sections from headings (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- ✅ Nested bullet lists with proper indentation
- ✅ Code blocks preserved as single blocks
- ✅ Checkbox support (`- [ ]` → TODO, `- [x]` → DONE)

**Update Modes:**
- **`append`** (default): Add new content after existing blocks
- **`replace`**: Clear page and replace with new content

### 🔁 Safe Retries & Large Writes

`create_page` fails with a clear error if a page with the same title already exists, instead of letting Logseq silently create numbered duplicates (`Page(1)`, `Page 2`, ...). This makes retries after a timeout safe: if a previous `create_page` call timed out but actually committed, the retry tells you the page exists rather than fragmenting your content across ghost pages.

For large writes, prefer this pattern over one giant `create_page` call:

1. Create the page with little or no content (`create_page` with just the title and properties)
2. Append content in smaller chunks with `update_page` (`mode: append`)
3. Read back with `get_page_content` to verify the result

If you hit the "already exists" error mid-ingest, use `get_page_content` to see what landed, then continue with `update_page` instead of re-creating.

- **MCP-compatible client** (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, etc.)

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
- **`LOGSEQ_API_TOKEN`** (required): Your LogSeq API token
- **`LOGSEQ_API_URL`** (optional): Server URL (default: `http://localhost:12315`)
- **`LOGSEQ_VERIFY_SSL`** (optional): Whether to verify the TLS certificate of an `https://` `LOGSEQ_API_URL`. Defaults to verifying when the URL is `https://`; set to `0`, `false`, or `no` to skip verification for self-signed certificates. Any other value enables verification.
- **`LOGSEQ_API_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`** (optional): HTTP connect timeout in seconds (default: `3`)
- **`LOGSEQ_API_READ_TIMEOUT`** (optional): HTTP read timeout in seconds (default: `6`)
- **`LOGSEQ_LOG_LEVEL`** (optional): Log verbosity — `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, or `CRITICAL` (default: `INFO`). Logs go to stderr. At `DEBUG`, the MCP SDK's own logger stays capped at `INFO` so full request payloads are not logged.
- **`LOGSEQ_LOG_FILE`** (optional): Path to a log file. When unset (the default), nothing is written to disk. Tool calls are logged with argument names and result sizes only, so page/block content does not appear in routine logs.
- **`LOGSEQ_DB_MODE`** (optional): Set to `true` to enable DB-mode property support. Only for Logseq DB-mode graphs (beta). Markdown/file-based graph users should leave this unset.
- **`LOGSEQ_EXCLUDE_TAGS`** (optional): Comma-separated tags — pages with these tags are hidden from all tools. See [Privacy & Access Control](#-privacy--access-control) below.
- **`LOGSEQ_INCLUDE_NAMESPACES`** (optional): Comma-separated namespace allow-list (e.g. `work,projects`). When set, **only** pages in these namespaces and their sub-pages are accessible — everything else, including top-level pages without a namespace, is hidden from listings/search and denied on direct access. See [Privacy & Access Control](#-privacy--access-control) below.
- **`LOGSEQ_EXCLUDE_NAMESPACES`** (optional): Comma-separated namespace deny-list (e.g. `finance,work/secret`). These namespaces are always blocked, taking priority over the include list. See [Privacy & Access Control](#-privacy--access-control) below.
- **`LOGSEQ_CONFIG_FILE`** (optional): Path to a shared JSON config file holding the graph path, ACL defaults, and the `vector` block. Env vars (`LOGSEQ_EXCLUDE_TAGS`, `LOGSEQ_INCLUDE_NAMESPACES`, `LOGSEQ_EXCLUDE_NAMESPACES`) override the matching keys in this file.
- **`MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN`** (required for `--transport http`): Bearer token clients must send as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The server refuses to start in HTTP mode without it. See [Serving over HTTP](docs/SERVING.md).

### Privacy & Access Control

Pages tagged with excluded tags are completely hidden from AI — they won't appear in listings, searches, or queries, and attempting to read them directly returns an access-denied error.

**Quick setup via env var:**
```bash
LOGSEQ_EXCLUDE_TAGS=private,secret
```

**Via config file** (also used for [vector search](VECTOR_SEARCH.md)):
```json
{
  "logseq_graph_path": "/path/to/your/logseq/pages",
  "exclude_tags": ["private", "secret"]
}
```
Point to it with `LOGSEQ_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/config.json`.

In your Logseq pages, tag any page you want to protect:
```
tags:: private
```

The exclusion applies to all tools: `list_pages`, `get_page_content`, `search`, `query`, and the optional vector search. If you also use vector search, `exclude_tags` at the root is automatically merged into the vector index exclusion list — private pages are never embedded.

#### Namespace access control

You can restrict access to specific namespaces using `LOGSEQ_INCLUDE_NAMESPACES` and `LOGSEQ_EXCLUDE_NAMESPACES`.

**Include list (strict allow-list):** Only the listed namespaces and their sub-pages are visible; everything else is hidden.
```bash
LOGSEQ_INCLUDE_NAMESPACES=work,projects
```

**Exclude list (deny-list):** The listed namespaces are always blocked, even if they appear in the include list.
```bash
LOGSEQ_EXCLUDE_NAMESPACES=work/secret,finance
```

**Via config file:**
```json
{
  "include_namespaces": ["work", "projects"],
  "exclude_namespaces": ["work/secret", "finance"]
}
```

Matching is segment-based and case-insensitive: `work` matches `work` and `work/projects` but not `workshop`. The behavior mirrors `LOGSEQ_EXCLUDE_TAGS`: list/search results silently omit blocked pages; direct read, write, delete, and block operations return an access-denied error.

Access control is enforced at the **page** level and applied across every tool: list/search/query results omit blocked pages, direct page/block access and backlinks are denied, and vector search is filtered. Block-level results from `search` and `query` are resolved back to their owning page, so a block belonging to a restricted page is filtered out of those results too.

**Index-time namespace scoping (vector DB only).** The keys above are *query-time*: every page is embedded, and blocked ones are filtered out of each response. For the vector DB you can also scope at *index time* — decide which namespaces are embedded into the DB **at all** — with `include_namespaces` / `exclude_namespaces` inside the `vector` block of the config file:

```json
{
  "vector": {
    "enabled": true,
    "include_namespaces": ["work"],
    "exclude_namespaces": ["work/secret"]
  }
}
```

This is global (it shapes the shared DB for every consumer), and it keeps unwanted content off disk entirely rather than filtering it on read — useful for secrets you never want embedded, or to keep the index small when everyone only cares about a subset. Matching is the same segment-based, case-insensitive rule. Because it changes what the index contains, it only takes effect after a full re-index: `logseq-sync --rebuild`.

### 🌐 Serving over HTTP, multi-profile & TLS

By default the server speaks **stdio** — your client spawns it as a subprocess, and most users need nothing more. To serve **sandboxed or remote clients** over the network, `mcp-logseq` can run as a long-lived HTTP service with bearer auth, per-profile isolation, and TLS:

```bash
mcp-logseq --transport http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 12320   # requires MCP_HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN
```

The full deployment guide — the server-side **security model**, the **per-profile multi-instance** pattern, the separate **`logseq-sync` writer**, and native **TLS** / reverse-proxy setup — lives in **[docs/SERVING.md](docs/SERVING.md)**. Non-loopback binds over plain HTTP are refused unless you supply TLS or pass `--insecure`.


### Alternative Setup Methods

#### Using .env file
```bash
# .env
LOGSEQ_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
LOGSEQ_API_URL=http://localhost:12315
```

#### System environment variables
```bash
export LOGSEQ_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
export LOGSEQ_API_URL=http://localhost:12315
```

## 🔍 Verification & Testing

### Test LogSeq Connection
```bash
uv run --with mcp-logseq python -c "
from mcp_logseq.logseq import LogSeq
api = LogSeq(api_key='your_token')
print(f'Connected! Found {len(api.list_pages())} pages')
"
```

### Verify MCP Registration
```bash
claude mcp list  # Should show mcp-logseq
```

### Debug with MCP Inspector
```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run --with mcp-logseq mcp-logseq
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "LOGSEQ_API_TOKEN environment variable required"
- ✅ Enable HTTP APIs in **Settings → Features**
- ✅ Click **🔌 button** → **"Start server"** in LogSeq
- ✅ Generate token in **API panel → Authorization tokens**
- ✅ Verify token in your configuration

#### "spawn uv ENOENT" (Claude Desktop)
Claude Desktop can't find `uv`. Use the full path:

```bash
which uv  # Find your uv location
```

Update config with full path:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-logseq": {
      "command": "/Users/username/.local/bin/uv",
      "args": ["run", "--with", "mcp-logseq", "mcp-logseq"],
      "env": { "LOGSEQ_API_TOKEN": "your_token_here" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Common uv locations:**
- Curl install: `~/.local/bin/uv`
- Homebrew: `/opt/homebrew/bin/uv` 
- Pip install: Check with `which uv`

#### Connection Issues
- ✅ Confirm LogSeq is running
- ✅ Verify API server is **started** (not just enabled)
- ✅ Check port 12315 is accessible
- ✅ Test with verification command above
